# Project Introduction

This project was developed as a collaborative exercise to learn and practice Git and GitHub.  
Our main goal was to understand how version control works in real development workflowsâ€”creating repositories, branching, merging, and documenting our work using Markdown.

By working directly with GitHub, we explored essential concepts such as pull requests, commit history, and collaborative editing.  
This experience gave us hands-on knowledge of how professional teams manage code, track changes, and work together efficiently.
